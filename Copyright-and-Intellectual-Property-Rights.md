# Open Source Licenses

**Note this next session is from [The Developer's Guide to Copyright Law - Part 1](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/01/24/TheDevelopersGuideToCopyrightLaw-Part1.aspx/)**

> ### Intro
> After finishing the Fogel book, “Producing Open Source Software”, I followed up
> by reading “Understanding Open Source and Free Software Licensing” by Andrew M.
> St. Laurent.
> 
> This book combined with previous readings serves as the inspiration and source
> for this series. I will focus on the issues pertinent to software developers
> who wish to get involved in open source development. For a more complete
> treatment of the topics, I recommend reading the books mentioned.
> 
> In this first post in this series, I will discuss the basics of copyright law.
> This will set the stage for part 2 in which I will discuss software licensing.
> 
> ### Basics of Copyright
> 
> In countries that support the Berne Convention, as soon as you set pen to
> paper, brush to canvas, or fingers to that dirty keyboard, the work you create
> is automatically afforded protection by copyright law. This assumes that your
> creation is not itself infringing on another’s copyright such as plagiarism.
> Also, there must be a small degree of creativity in the work. For example, you
> cannot simply jot down and copyright names copied from a phone book. Additional
> copyright protection is available through registration with the copyright
> office, but registration is not required.
> 
> Note that copyright applies to a particular expression of an idea, not to the
> idea itself. You can copyright a specific drawing of a penguin, but your
> copyright does not apply to drawings of penguins in general. Trademarks and
> patents are used to provide legal protections for concepts, ideas, facts
> outside of the scope of copyright law, but that is a topic out of scope for
> this post.
> 
> ### The Rights of Copyright
> 
> So exactly what rights do you have to copyrighted works? Well the obvious right
> is the right to copy. A copyright gives the owner full and exclusive rights to
> control who may copy or create a derivative of a work and how that may be done.
> As a copyright owner, you may state that nobody is allowed to copy or make
> derivative versions of your work (though the doctrine of “fair use” allows some
> non-infringing uses such as quoting from the work in a book review). A
> copyright gives the owner exclusive rights to a work, but this protection does
> not last forever.
> 
> If someone were to infringe on your copyright, you have the right to sue for
> damages, but this requires that you prove a loss occurred due to the
> infringement, which can be difficult. You may receive additional copyright
> protection by registering the work with the copyright office. For example, you
> can get “statutory damages”, compensation fixed by law that does not require
> proving an actual loss.
> 
> ### Who Owns Your Code?
> 
> Therefore you own the copyright to every line of code you write. Well... sort
> of.
> 
> The code a developer writes while an employee or client fall under the doctrine
> of “work for hire” and therefore belong to the employer (or client). Some
> independent contractors will stipulate in their service agreement with the
> client that even though the client owns the copyright to the code, the client
> shall give the contractor a non-exclusive license to the code.
> 
> ### Next Time: Licensing
> 
> In the next post in this series, I will discuss licensing and get into the
> nitty gritty as it pertains to open source software. Many thanks to my friend
> Walter Impert for his legal editing.
