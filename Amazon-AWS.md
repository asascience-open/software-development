## Services

### EC-2
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides
resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud
computing easier for developers.

Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure
capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your
computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment.
Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to
minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your
computing requirements change. Amazon EC2 changes the economics of computing by
allowing you to pay only for capacity that you actually use. Amazon EC2
provides developers the tools to build failure resilient applications and
isolate themselves from common failure scenarios.
